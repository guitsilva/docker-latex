# Docker-LaTeX

LaTeX environment within Docker containers based on Ubuntu LTS and non-full TeX Live. This environment is used by this repository owner to build his academic LaTeX projects: papers, posters, presentations, theses, etc. Therefore, the Docker image is way smaller than `texlive-full` ones and rather personal.
